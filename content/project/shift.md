The Nitrado Jam, an internal event for employees and friends of the company, presented a unique opportunity for me to explore new horizons in game development.

During this two-day Game Jam, with "Parallel Universe" as the theme, I conceptualized "SHIFT": a split-screen bullet hell game. 
The core mechanic hinges on the player shifting between two "worlds" by pressing the shift key.

I chose TypeScript and Phaser for development, driven by my growing interest in web-based games.
