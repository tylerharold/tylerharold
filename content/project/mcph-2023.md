In late 2022, I set a transformative goal at MCProHosting: to reinvent our visual identity.
This journey began when we identified serious accessibility flaws in our existing design system. 
Simultaneously, our products and software had outgrown the constraints of this outdated framework, a problem painfully evident in our coding challenges.

As our portfolio expanded with specialized products and innovative marketing campaigns, it became clear that our rigid design system was inadequate. 
The analogy that best describes it is a drawing that loses its essence when flipped - our system was similarly inflexible. 
We were grappling with design elements like dark backgrounds paired with jarring colors, abrupt shifts in color tones, and combinations that were visually discordant. 
Navigating these design limitations while growing as a company was a significant challenge.

Determined to turn the tide, I focused on:
- Refreshing our brandâ€™s palette, introducing a more harmonious color scheme.
- Expanding our color range to include gradients from 100 to 900, enhancing versatility across various applications.
- Establishing clear standards for call-to-action elements, thereby sharpening the focus and objectives on each page.
