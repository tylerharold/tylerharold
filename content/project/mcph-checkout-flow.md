# MCProHosting: A Simplified Checkout Flow

![MCProHosting Checkout Comparison](/img/mcph-cfg-preview.png)

At MCProHosting, we had a serious flaw with our checkout funnel: it was hard to checkout.

Customers experienced slow page loads, inconsistent data, visually unappealing color clashes, and the development side was equally challenging.
Our infrastructure made updates difficult and often led to instability.

I tackled this problem head-on with a three-pronged approach:
1. **Integration with Our Products API:** We shifted the checkout process from WHMCS to our Laravel-based site. 
This move drastically reduced database calls and enabled end-to-end caching. Furthermore, we adopted a templating system that was more cooperative, streamlining the entire process.
2. **Incorporating Vue in the Checkout Process:** We had already begun integrating Vue into our custom control panel, OneControlCenter, with noticeable improvements in managing state and enhancing the developer experience.
Extending Vue to the checkout process was a natural progression, enabling us to handle this complex system more effectively.
3. **Design Simplification:** The existing design was a hodgepodge of clashing colors and themes, with unclear call-to-action elements.
The redesign focused on simplicity and clarity. For instance, options like changing locations were made more intuitive, ensuring users could easily understand and interact with the interface.

Through these strategic changes, we transformed a cumbersome checkout process into a streamlined, user-friendly experience, benefiting both our customers and developers.
