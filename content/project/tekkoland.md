# Tekkoland: A web-based social MMORPG 

![Tekkoland Preview](/img/tekkoland.png)

Growing up, I was captivated by the world of chatrooms and social games. Titles like WeeWorld, Habbo Hotel, and Roblox weren’t just games to me; 
they were gateways to endless hours of fun and camaraderie. It’s no surprise that the idea of creating my own game, one that fused these social elements with RPG features, 
quickly evolved from a hobbyist’s daydream to a full-fledged aspiration. Now, the dream has shifted slightly — it’s all about actually launching one!

While my project, Tekkoland, didn’t make it to launch, it was far from a setback. 
Instead, it was an incredible journey of growth and learning. Tackling this project solo meant wearing multiple hats, and it was an experience that notably enhanced my understanding 
of WebSockets and networking.

Tekkoland grew into a substantial endeavor before it reached its conclusion. It was brimming with features that I’m particularly proud of:

- **A Robust Room and Friend System:** Designed to foster community and connection, mirroring the camaraderie I cherished in my favorite childhood games.
- **An Advanced NPC & Event System:** This wasn’t just about NPCs who stood around. They moved, they conversed, and they engaged players with tasks and stories, bringing the game world to life.
- **Extensive Player and House Customization:** Ensuring each player could create a unique identity and space, mirroring their style and preferences.

If I added another year or two, I’m confident Tekkoland would have been a blast. The passion that fueled its inception still burns brightly. 
It’s more than just an unfinished project; it’s a dream I’m definitely planning to revisit and bring to fruition. 
The journey of Tekkoland has been a pivotal chapter in my game development story, and I can’t wait to see where this path leads next.
