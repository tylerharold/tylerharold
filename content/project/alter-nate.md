# Alter-Nate: Ludum Dare 47

![Alter-Nate Preview](/img/alternate.jpg)

My first Game Jam experience at Ludum Dare 47 turned out to be my most successful. In a team of five, we developed a 2.5D platformer puzzle game.
The plot revolves around "Nate," trapped in a time loop and seeking a way out through a series of altered maps and clues leading to a doctor.

Using C# and Unity, we created an engaging game world in just two days, featuring a key and keypad system, an inventory mechanism, and a definitive end goal.
This project was a rapid, collaborative effort that effectively combined creativity and technical skill within a tight timeframe.
