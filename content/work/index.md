**Focus**

In recent years, I have leveraged my background in both engineering and design in various roles and contributions. 
Within team settings, I naturally lean towards a front-end focus, specializing in crafting exceptional user experiences. 
My diverse background enables me to proficiently handle both design and development aspects independently when required. 
In situations where I work solo or placed in a more senior role, I am fully capable of assuming a full-stack position, 
efficiently transforming concepts into production-ready solutions.

**Principles**
- Good user experiences are subconscious.
- Embrace the right tool for each job.
- There is no such thing as readable code.
- Maintain the curiosity and eagerness of a Junior Engineer. 
- Share that curiosity and eagerness with others!
