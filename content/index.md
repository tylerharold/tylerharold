Hey, I'm Tyler! Welcome to my little corner of the web.

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer based in Lakeland, FL where I'm currently working @ [Apex Hosting](https://apexminecrafthosting.com) in a products-focused engineering role.
We have a lot of cool stuff coming later this year so stay tuned!

Outside of work, I'm currently working on a PBBG game called [Fablefront](https://discord.gg/zkKGwJtEts). I've recently written an article about my inspiration for Fablefront & making this site
[here](/blog/01-coming-full-circle). It's an interesting article that goes into my thought process as I've grown as an engineer, please give it a read if that interests you.

I'm also currently:
- Building an FDM 3D Print Farm :printer:
- Diving into Embedded Programming w/ Rust :crab:
- Filming with my Nikon Z6 II :camera:
